## My Approach
ðŸš² Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study â€” My Thinking Process

I approached this project like a real data analyst solving a business problem.
First, I defined the goal: to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic differently and identify ways to increase memberships.

I collected and combined 12 months of ride data using Excel and Power Query, cleaned missing and irrelevant fields, and created new variables such as ride length and day of week to reveal behavioral patterns.

Next, I built pivot tables and visualizations to analyze trends over time.
I noticed strong seasonal patterns â€” annual members rode steadily through the year (mainly for commuting), while casual riders peaked in warmer months and weekends (for leisure).

Based on these insights, I concluded that Cyclistic should focus on attracting new members and offer flexible, leisure-friendly plans instead of forcing conversion from casual riders.

This project strengthened my skills in data cleaning, pattern recognition, and business communication, turning raw data into actionable insights.
